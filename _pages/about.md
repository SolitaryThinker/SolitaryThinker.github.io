Hi, I am a PhD student at UC San Diego, working on video generation. I lead the development of [FastVideo](https://github.com/hao-ai-lab/FastVideo), a unified inference and post-training framework for accelerated video generation.

I am interested in the following topics:
- Video Generation
- Training and Distillation of Diffusion Models
