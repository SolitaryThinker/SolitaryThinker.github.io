Hi, I am a PhD student at UC San Diego, advised by [Prof. Hao Zhang](https://haozhang.ai/), working on video generation. 

I lead the development of [FastVideo](https://github.com/hao-ai-lab/FastVideo), a unified inference and post-training framework for accelerated video generation. I am also an intern at Anyscale.

I previously worked with [Prof. Yiying Zhang](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~yiying/) on accelerating datacenter networking.

I am interested in the following topics:
- Video Generation
- World Models
- Training and Distillation of Diffusion Models
